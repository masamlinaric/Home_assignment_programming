*Brief description:* This is the code for the home assignment for my Programming Course at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. This code visualises brain regions that are typically associated with reading and creates a histogram to show the distribution of positive z-scores in my functional file. The goal is to understand which brain regions have been found to be connected to reading.


*A list of python packages used:*<br>
- glob
