*Brief description:* This is the code for the home assignment for my Programming Course at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. This code visualises brain regions that are typically associated with reading and creates a histogram to show the distribution of positive z-scores in my functional file. The goal is to understand which brain regions have been found to be connected to reading.

*Data used:*
I used the openly available fMRI data on Neurosynht (https://neurosynth.org/). File with high resolution MRI anatomical data as well as file with functional data (statistical map) were used. The consept of *reading* was selected for investigation. Both files were downloaded from the Neurosynth webpage and stored in this project reposiroty.

*Files in this reposiroty:* Besides the files from the Neurosynth webpage, you can find a file with my code called **home_assignment.ipynb** and a screenshot of my comments to another student's similar repository.

*A list of python packages used:*<br>
- glob
-  os
-  nilearn
-  nibabel
-  matplotlib
